# Welcome!

First off, this is not meant to be political in any way. Rather, this is a potential solution to the ugliness politics has often become. 
If this is done correctly, it should be able to be used in any country, state, province, territory, county, city, region. 

#  How does it work?

First, every registered voter would need to link an email address to their government ID. This should be done in person, but can be updated with a video call (Google Meets, Zoom, etc). A hash can be generated for every election or however frequently is needed. The government ID numbers should still stay hidden, but the email and the name can be less protected.

#  Why Email?

Most email servers allow Multi Factor Authentication. As long as the email account is protected with strong MFA (authenticator apps are preferred, passkeys should be available / robust soon).
Once you have a trusted accounting of only one valid email address per registered voter, you can prove that only currently registered voters are able to vote. 




# Generate a Unique User ID

@[This makes a unique hash out of pieces of information, like first name, last name, state, etc]({"stubs": ["test.py"], "command": "python3 test.py"})
