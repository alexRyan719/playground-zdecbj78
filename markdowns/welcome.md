# Welcome!

First off, this is not meant to be political in any way. Rather, this is a potential solution to the ugliness politics has often become. 
If this is done correctly, it should be able to be used in any country, state, province, territory, county, city, region. 

#  How does it work?

First, every registered voter would need to link an email address to their government ID. This should be done in person, but can be updated with a video call (Google Meets, Zoom, etc). A hash can be generated for every election or however frequently is needed. The government ID numbers should still stay hidden, but the email and the name can be less protected.

#  Why Email?

Most email servers allow Multi Factor Authentication. As long as the email account is protected with strong MFA (authenticator apps are preferred, passkeys should be available / robust soon).
Once you have a trusted accounting of only one valid email address per registered voter, you can prove that only currently registered voters are able to vote.

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`python-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/tree/master/python-project)
A simple Python project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/blob/master/techio.yml)
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.
